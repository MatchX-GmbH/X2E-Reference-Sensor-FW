# This file contains recommended default configuration variables
# when using ubxlib as a Zephyr module. It is used when your
# CMakeList.txt brings in ubxlib with the line:
#
# include($ENV{UBXLIB_DIR}/zephyr/ubxlib.cmake).
#
# The contents of this file may be EXCLUDED by specifying the
# CMake variable UBXLIB_NO_DEF_CONF.

# Individual configuration variables defined here can be overridden
# when needed in the application prj.conf.

# Always required

# This file should contain the paths to all header and source
# files that are required for building ubxlib on PlatformIO.
# Paths are relative to the ubxlib root directory, forward-slashes
# must be used.
# Note that test/automation and the examples from the ubxlib root
# directory are NOT brought in here since they are not required for
# normal use: for those see inc_src_test.txt.
# Framework specific directories will only be included for the
# actual framework used and ignored otherwise.
# For references to the current build framework the macro
# $FRAMEWORK can be used.

# This section contains regular expressions matching paths which
# should be excluded in subsequent wild card searches

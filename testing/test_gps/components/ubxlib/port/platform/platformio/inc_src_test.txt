# This file should contain the paths to additional header and source
# files that are required for building the test/automation
# code of ubxlib on PlatformIO; for the ubxlib core code see
# inc_src.txt.
# Paths are relative to the ubxlib root directory, forward-slashes
# must be used.
# For references to the current build framework the macro
# $FRAMEWORK can be used.
# Note: there is no need to mention the test files of a module
# here, those are automatically brought in based on the modules
# already listed in inc_src.txt when this file is included.

# This section contains regular expressions matching paths which

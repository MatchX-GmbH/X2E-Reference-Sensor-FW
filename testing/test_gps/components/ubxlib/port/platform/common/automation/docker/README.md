This folder contains Docker-related things that are used by the test automation:
- `builder`: things needed for creating the `ubxlib_builder` container,
- `host`: contains a script and additions for setting up a new Ubuntu machine to run ubxlib docker containers; these are NO LONGER USED (since what was on Ubuntu has now moved to the Raspberry Pi and with the Raspberry Pi you can just copy the SSD from Pi to Pi, multiple installations not required).

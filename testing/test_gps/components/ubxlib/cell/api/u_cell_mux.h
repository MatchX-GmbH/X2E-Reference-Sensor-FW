/** Enable multiplexer mode.  Puts the cellular module's AT
 * interface into multiplexer (3GPP 27.010 CMUX) mode.  This
 * is useful when you want to access a GNSS module that is
 * connected via, or embedded inside, a cellular module as if it
 * were connected directly to this MCU via a serial interface (see
 * uCellMuxAddChannel()).  Note that this function _internally_
 * opens and uses a CMUX channel for the AT interface, you do not
 * have to do that.  The AT handle that was originally passed to
 * uCellAdd() will remain locked, the handle of the new one that is
 * created for use internally can be obtained by calling
 * uCellAtClientHandleGet(); uCellAtClientHandleGet() will always
 * return the AT handle currently in use.
 *
 * Whether multiplexer mode is supported or not depends on the cellular
 * module and the interface in use: for instance a USB interface to
 * a module does not support multiplexer mode.
 *
 * The module must be powered on for this to work.  Returns success
 * without doing anything if multiplexer mode is already enabled.
 * Multiplexer mode does not survive a power-cycle, either deliberate
 * (with uCellPwrOff(), uCellPwrReboot(), etc.) or accidental, and
 * cannot be used with 3GPP power saving (since it will also be
 * reset during module deep sleep).
 *
 * Note: if you have passed the AT handle to a GNSS instance (e.g.
 * via uGnssAdd()) it will stop working when multiplexer mode is
 * enabled (because the AT handle will have been changed), hence you
 * should enable multiplexer mode _before_ calling uGnssAdd()
 * (and, likewise, remove any GNSS instance before disabling
 * multiplexer mode).  However, if you have enabled multiplexer
 * mode it is much better to call uCellMuxAddChannel() with
 * #U_CELL_MUX_CHANNEL_ID_GNSS and then you can pass the
 * #uDeviceSerial_t handle that returns to uGnssAdd() (with the
 * transport type #U_GNSS_TRANSPORT_VIRTUAL_SERIAL) and you will
 * have streamed position.
 *
 * @param cellHandle the handle of the cellular instance.
 * @return           zero on success or negative error code on failure.
 */
int32_t uCellMuxEnable(uDeviceHandle_t cellHandle);

/** Determine if the multiplexer is currently enabled.
 *
 * @param cellHandle the handle of the cellular instance.
 * @return           true if the multiplexer is enabled, else false.
 */
bool uCellMuxIsEnabled(uDeviceHandle_t cellHandle);

/** Add a multiplexer channel; may be called after uCellMuxEnable()
 * has returned success in order to, for instance, create a virtual
 * serial port to a GNSS chip inside a SARA-R422M8S or SARA-R510M8S
 * module.  The virtual serial port handle returned in *ppDeviceSerial
 * can be used in #uDeviceCfg_t to open the GNSS device using the
 * uDevice API, or it can be passed to uGnssAdd() (with the transport
 * type #U_GNSS_TRANSPORT_VIRTUAL_SERIAL) if you prefer to use the
 * uGnss API the hard way.
 *
 * If the channel is already open, this function returns success
 * without doing anything.  An error is returned if uCellMuxEnable()
 * has not been called.
 *
 * Note: there is a known issue with SARA-R5 modules where, if a GNSS
 * multiplexer channel is opened, closed, and then re-opened the GNSS
 * chip will be unresponsive.  For that case, please open the GNSS
 * multiplexer channel once at start of day.
 *
 * UART POWER SAVING: when UART power saving is enabled in the module
 * any constraints arising will also apply to a multiplexer channel;
 * specifically, if a DTR pin is not used to wake-up the module, i.e.
 * the module supports and is using the "wake up on TX activity" mode
 * of UART power saving then, though the AT interface will continue
 * to work correctly (as it knows to expect loss of the first few
 * characters of an AT string), the other multiplexer channels have
 * the same restriction and have no such automated protection. Hence
 * if you (a) expect to use a multiplexer channel to communicate with
 * a GNSS chip in a cellular module and (b) are not able to use a DTR
 * pin to wake the module up from power-saving, then you should call
 * uCellPwrDisableUartSleep() to disable UART sleep while you run the
 * multiplexer channel (and uCellPwrEnableUartSleep() to re-enable it
 * afterwards).
 *
 * NOTES ON DEVICE SERIAL OPERATION: the operation of *pDeviceSerial
 * is constrained in certain ways, since what you have is not a real
 * serial port, it is a virtual serial port which has hijacked some
 * of the functionality of the physical serial port that was
 * previously running, see notes below, but particularly flow control,
 * or not taking data out of one or more multiplexed serial ports fast
 * enough, can have an adverse effect on other multiplexed serial ports.
 * This is difficult to avoid since they are on the same transport.  Hence
 * it is important to service your multiplexed serial ports often or,
 * alternatively, you may call serialDiscardOnFlowControl() with true
 * on any serial port where you are happy for any overruns to be
 * discarded (e.g. the GNSS one), so that it cannot possibly interfere
 * with others (e.g. the AT command one).
 *
 * The stack size and priority of any event serial callbacks are not
 * respected: what you end up with is #U_CELL_MUX_CALLBACK_TASK_PRIORITY
 * and #U_CELL_MUX_CALLBACK_TASK_STACK_SIZE_BYTES since a common
 * event queue is used for all serial devices.
 *
 * @param cellHandle          the handle of the cellular instance.
 * @param channel             the channel number to open; channel
 *                            numbers are module-specific, however
 *                            the value #U_CELL_MUX_CHANNEL_ID_GNSS
 *                            can be used, in all cases, to open a
 *                            channel to an embedded GNSS chip.
 *                            Note that channel zero is reserved
 *                            for management operations and channel
 *                            one is the existing AT interface;
 *                            neither value can be used here.
 * @param[out] ppDeviceSerial a pointer to a place to put the
 *                            handle of the virtual serial port
 *                            that is the multiplexer channel.

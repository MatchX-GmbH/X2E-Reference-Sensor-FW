# prj.conf
#
# This file is used when testing inclusion of ubxlib as
# a Zephyr module by setting the CMake variable
# ZEPHYR_EXTRA_MODULES to the root directory of ubxlib.
#
# These are the *absolute* *minimum* set of CONFIG values
# required by ubxlib.

# Always needed
CONFIG_UBXLIB=y

# When using the Zephyr minimal libc we don't want to use the libc
# memory management since it does not use k_malloc, resulting in
# two heaps which might waste a lot of memory. Therefore we map
# malloc/free directly to k_malloc/k_free and disable libc RAM
# with CONFIG_MINIMAL_LIBC_MALLOC=n.
# If newlib is being used this will be ignored.
CONFIG_MINIMAL_LIBC_MALLOC=n

# ubxlib does not need anything like this much heap, this is simply
# a suggestion for your application, feel free to override it.
CONFIG_HEAP_MEM_POOL_SIZE=131072

# Required for uPortTaskStackMinFree() to work
CONFIG_INIT_STACKS=y
CONFIG_THREAD_STACK_INFO=y
CONFIG_THREAD_NAME=y

# You will need additional configuration variables depending
# on the features of ubxlib/Zephyr required.
#
# See port/platform/zephyr/default.conf for the recommended set,
# so slightly more than this file, that are brought in automatically
# if you bring ubxlib into your CMakeLists.txt file with the line
#
# include($ENV{UBXLIB_DIR}/zephyr/ubxlib.cmake)
#
# ...rather than using ZEPHYR_EXTRA_MODULES.
#
# See port/platform/zephyr/runner/prj.conf and/or
# port/platform/zephyr/runner_linux/prj.conf for the detailed
# set of items, needed to select I2C, SPI, various BLE things,
# etc., which we employ when testing.

 *                                      If you intend to send the RRLP information
 *                                      to the Cloud Locate service then, for
 *                                      #U_GNSS_RRLP_MODE_MEASX you MUST include
 *                                      the six bytes of message header of the UBX
 *                                      protocol, i.e. 0xB5 62 02 14 AA BB (where
 *                                      0xAA BB is the [little-endian coded] 16-bit
 *                                      length of the RRLP data that follows) AND
 *                                      the two CRC bytes on the end, as the Cloud
 *                                      Locate service expects these and checks
 *                                      them.  However, when using the other formats
 *                                      the header and CRC bytes must NOT be sent to
 *                                      the Cloud Locate service, hence you should
 *                                      offset your read from pBuffer by six
 *                                      bytes to skip the header and take eight from
 *                                      the length to also remove the two CRC bytes.
 * @param sizeBytes                     the number of bytes of storage at pBuffer.
 * @param svsThreshold                  the minimum number of satellites that must
 *                                      be visible to return the RRLP information;
 *                                      specify -1 for "don't care"; the recommended
 *                                      value to use for the Cloud Locate service is 5.
 *                                      Ignored if the RRLP mode is not
 *                                      #U_GNSS_RRLP_MODE_MEASX, since in those cases
 *                                      the thresholding is performed in the GNSS module.
 * @param cNoThreshold                  the minimum carrier to noise value that must
 *                                      be met to return the RRLP information, range
 *                                      0 to 63; specify -1 for "don't care".  The
 *                                      ideal value to use for the Cloud Locate service
 *                                      is 35 but that requires clear sky and a good
 *                                      antenna, hence the recommended value is 30;
 *                                      lower threshold values may work, just less
 *                                      reliably. Ignored if the RRLP mode is not
 *                                      #U_GNSS_RRLP_MODE_MEASX, since in those cases
 *                                      the thresholding is performed in the GNSS module.
 * @param multipathIndexLimit           the maximum multipath index that must be
 *                                      met to return the RRLP information, 1 = low,

 *                                      care".  The recommended value for the Cloud
 *                                      Locate service is 1. Ignored if the RRLP mode
 *                                      is not #U_GNSS_RRLP_MODE_MEASX, since in those
 *                                      cases the thresholding is performed in the GNSS
 *                                      module.
 * @param pseudorangeRmsErrorIndexLimit the maximum pseudorange RMS error index that
 *                                      must be met to return the RRLP information;
 *                                      specify -1 for "don't care".  The recommended
 *                                      value for the Cloud Locate service is 3.

 *                                      #U_GNSS_RRLP_MODE_MEASX, since in those cases

 * @param[in] pKeepGoingCallback        a callback function that governs the wait. This
 *                                      This function is called while waiting for RRLP
 *                                      data that meets the criteria; the API will
 *                                      only continue to wait while the callback function
 *                                      returns true.  This allows the caller to terminate
 *                                      the process at their convenience. The function may
 *                                      also be used to feed any watchdog timer that

/** Monitor the output of the GNSS chip for the given message,
 * non-blocking.  This may be called multiple times; to stop listening
 * for a given message type, call uGnssMsgPrivateReceiveStop() with
 * the handle returned by this function.  There can be a maximum of
 * #U_GNSS_MSG_RECEIVER_MAX_NUM of these running at any one time.
 * Message handlers callbacks are called mostly-recently-added first.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: this does not work for modules connected via an AT
 * transport, please instead open a Virtual Serial connection for
 * that case (see uCellMuxAddChannel()).
 *
 * @param[in] pInstance          a pointer to the GNSS instance, cannot
 *                               be NULL.
 * @param[in] pPrivateMessageId  a pointer to the message ID to capture;
 *                               a copy will be taken so this may be
 *                               on the stack; cannot be NULL.
 * @param[in] pCallback          the callback to be called when a
 *                               matching message arrives.  It is up to
 *                               pCallback to read the message with a
 *                               call to uGnssMsgReceiveCallbackRead();
 *                               this should be done as quickly as possible
 *                               so that the callback can return as quickly
 *                               as possible, otherwise there is a chance
 *                               of data loss as the internal buffer fills
 *                               up. The entire message, with any header, $,
 *                               checksum, etc. will be included.
 *                               IMPORTANT: the ONLY GNSS API calls that
 *                               pCallback may make are
 *                               uGnssMsgReceiveCallbackRead() and
 *                               uGnssMsgReceiveCallbackExtract(), no others
 *                               or you risk getting mutex-locked.  pCallback
 *                               cannot be NULL.
 * @param[in] pCallbackParam     will be passed to pCallback as its last
 *                               parameter.
 * @return                       a handle for this asynchronous reader on
 *                               success, else negative error code.

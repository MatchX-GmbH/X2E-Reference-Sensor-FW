# Introduction to `ubxlib`
This repository contains an add-on to microcontroller and RTOS SDKs for building embedded applications with u-blox products and services. It provides portable C libraries which expose APIs with examples. `ubxlib` supports [u-blox](https://www.u-blox.com) modules with [cellular](https://www.u-blox.com/en/cellular-modules) (2G/3G/4G), [short-range](https://www.u-blox.com/en/short-range-radio-chips-and-modules) (Bluetooth and Wi-Fi) and [positioning](https://www.u-blox.com/en/positioning-chips-and-modules) (GNSS) functionality. The `ubxlib` libraries present high level C APIs for use in customer applications (e.g. connect to a network, open a TCP socket, establish location, etc.) and implements these APIs on selected popular MCUs, also available inside u-blox modules.

The goal of `ubxlib` is to deliver a single tested solution, with examples, which provides uniform easy-to-use APIs across several u-blox products. Releases of `ubxlib` are tested automatically for all configurations on multiple boards in a [test farm](/port/platform/common/automation/DATABASE.md).

![ubxlib high level overview](/readme_images/ubxlib_high_level.png)

The easiest way to quickly explore `ubxlib` is to start with a board listed in the [test farm](/port/platform/common/automation/DATABASE.md). u-blox EVKs (evaluation kits) or application boards can be found [here](https://www.u-blox.com/en/evk-search) or at major electronics distributors and code examples which run on the u-blox [XPLR-IOT-1 platform](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/xplr-iot-1) can be found [here](https://github.com/u-blox/ubxlib_examples_xplr_iot).  If you've heard enough and want to get started with the [XPLR-IOT-1 platform](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/xplr-iot-1), or maybe with [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/), jump straight to **[How To Use This Repo](#how-to-use-this-repo)** below.

`ubxlib` runs on a host microcontroller and has a peripheral attached. This setup is very common in embedded applications. An example of such a host-peripheral configuration with EVK-NINA-B301 (Bluetooth 5.0) and EVK-R4 (SARA-R4 with 2G/3G/4G) in which the `ubxlib` host sets up a TCP connection is shown in the following figure. Many other combinations can be achieved, with the supported hosts and peripherals in the tables in the next section.

# APIs
The key APIs provided by this repo, and their relationships with each other, are shown in the picture below.

![APIs](/readme_images/apis.jpg)

- If you wish to bring up a device/network and don't care about the details, use the common [device](/common/device) and [network](/common/network) APIs, which can bring up cellular, BLE/Wi-Fi or GNSS network(s) at your choosing.
- If you wish to use a socket over that network, use the common [sock](/common/sock) API.
- If you wish to use security, use the common [security](/common/security) API.
- If you wish to contact an MQTT broker over that network, use the common [mqtt_client](/common/mqtt_client) API.
- If you wish to use HTTP, use the common [http_client](/common/http_client) API.
- If you wish to get a location fix use the common [location](/common/location) API.
- If you wish to take finer control of [cellular](/cell), [ble](/ble), [wifi](/wifi) or [gnss](/gnss), use the respective control API directly.
- GNSS may be used via the [gnss](/gnss) API.
- The BLE and Wi-Fi APIs are internally common within u-blox and so they both use the common [short_range](/common/short_range) API.
- The [at_client](/common/at_client) API is used by the cellular and short range APIs to talk to AT-based u-blox modules.
- The [ubx_protocol](/common/ubx_protocol) API implements the necessary encoding/decoding to talk to u-blox GNSS modules.
- The [port](/port) API permits all of the above to run on different hosts; this API is not really intended for customer use - you can use it if you wish but it is quite restricted and is intended only to provide what `ubxlib` needs in the form that `ubxlib` needs it.

All APIs are documented with Doxygen compatible comments: simply download the latest [Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/) and either run it from the `ubxlib` directory at a command prompt or open [Doxyfile](/Doxyfile) in the Doxygen GUI and run it to obtain the output.

# Supported `ubxlib` host platforms and APIs
Hosts run `ubxlib` and interact with an attached periperal. A host platform contains an MCU, toolchain and RTOS/SDK as listed in the table below. Hosts are typically u-blox open CPU (standalone) modules or other MCUs. To use a host you need a development board or an EVK. Currently `ubxlib` supports and tests the following purchasable boards out-of-the box.

- [u-blox XPLR-IOT-1](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/xplr-iot-1)
- [u-blox XPLR-HPG-1](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/xplr-hpg-1)
- [u-blox XPLR-HPG-2](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/xplr-hpg-2)
- [u-blox C030-U201 board](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/c030-application-board)
- [u-blox NINA-W1 EVK](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/evk-nina-w10)
- [Nordic nRF52840 DK board](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nrf52840-dk)
- [Nordic nRF5340 DK board](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nRF5340-DK)
- [STM32F4 Discovery board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f4discovery.html)
- [ESP32-DevKitC](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits/esp32-devkitc/overview)



If your MCU is on the list but your board is not:
- just set the HW pins in the source file of the example to match how your MCU is wired to the u-blox peripheral.

If your MCU is not on the list:
- if you are using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) and [Zephyr](https://www.zephyrproject.org/) then any MCU that Zephyr supports should work with `ubxlib`, just follow the instructions [here](/port/platform/platformio) to bring `ubxlib` into your existing [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) environment,
- otherwise, to port `ubxlib` to a new host platform follow the [DIY instructions](/port#diy) for the port API.

# Supported modules as `ubxlib` peripherals and APIs
Peripherals are u-blox modules which accept commands (e.g. AT-commands) over a serial interface and have no open MCU environment. To run the APIs they need to be attached to a host which runs `ubxlib`. For example in the [test farm](/port/platform/common/automation/DATABASE.md) combinations of hosts and peripherals are listed.

# Structure of `ubxlib`
The APIs for each type of u-blox module can be found in the relevant directory (e.g. [cell](/cell) for cellular modules and [ble](/ble)/[wifi](/wifi) for BLE/Wi-Fi modules).  The [common](/common) directory contains APIs and 'helper' modules that are shared by u-blox modules, most importantly the [device](/common/device) API, the [network](/common/network) API and the [sockets](/common/sockets) API.  All APIs are documented in the API header files.

Examples demonstrating the use of the APIs can be found in the [example](/example) directory.  If you are using Zephyr or the u-blox [XPLR-IOT-1 platform](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/xplr-iot-1) you will find examples that are very simple to install and use in https://github.com/u-blox/ubxlib_examples_xplr_iot.

Each API includes a `test` sub-directory containing the tests for that API which you may compile and run if you wish.

Build information for each platform can be found in the [platform](/port/platform) sub-directory of [port](/port); more on this below.

In order for u-blox to support multiple platforms with this code there is also a [port API](/port/api).  This is not intended to be a generic porting API, it is simply sufficient to support the APIs we require.  If you have not chosen a supported platform you may still be able to use the high level APIs here unchanged by [implementing the port API](/port#diy) for your platform.

# How to use this Repo
There are a few possible approaches to adopting `ubxlib`.  If you do not have a fixed environment (MCU, toolchain, RTOS, etc.) then the first two options offer an easy start; if you are constrained in how you must work (i.e. you must use a particular MCU or toolchain or RTOS), or you are happy to dive into the detail from the outset, then the third way is for you.

## The Easy Way 1: XPLR IoT
If you would like to explore cellular, positioning, Wifi and BLE, along with a suite of sensors, all at once, you might consider purchasing a u-blox [XPLR-IOT-1 platform](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/xplr-iot-1) and using the associated [ubxlib examples repo](https://github.com/u-blox/ubxlib_examples_xplr_iot), which allows you to install, build and run [Zephyr](https://www.zephyrproject.org/)-based applications.

## The Easy Way 2: PlatformIO
`ubxlib` is supported as a [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) library; if you have a board that either (a) runs [Zephyr](https://www.zephyrproject.org/) or (b) contains an ESP32 chip (running [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html) or [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)), then just follow the instructions [here](/port/platform/platformio) to load `ubxlib` directly into the [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) Visual Studio Code-based IDE.

## The Hard Way: Down in the Detail
This repo uses Git submodules: make sure that once it has been cloned you do something like:

`git submodule update --init --recursive`

...to obtain the submodules.

The native SDKs for each supported platform are used directly, unchanged, by this code.  To use this repo you must first choose your MCU and associated platform.  For instance, you might choose an STM32F4 MCU, which is supported via ST's STM32Cube IDE.  Instructions for how to install and use each platform can be found in your chosen MCU sub-directory; for an STM32F4 MCU this would be [port/platform/stm32cube/mcu/stm32f4](/port/platform/stm32cube/mcu/stm32f4).

Having chosen your MCU and installed the platform tools, navigate to the directories below your chosen MCU directory to find the required build information.  For instance, you may find a `runner` directory, which is a generic build that compiles any or all of the examples and tests that can run on a given platform.  In that directory you will find detailed information on how to perform the build.

Configuration information for the examples and the tests can be found in the `cfg` directory of your chosen MCU.  Depending on how you have connected your MCU to a u-blox module you may need to override this configuration, e.g. to change which MCU pin is connected to which pin of the u-blox module.  The `README.md` in the `runner` directory of your chosen MCU will tell you how to override conditional compilation flags in order to do this.

# Examples
A number of examples are provided with this repo:

|  Technology  | Example |
|--------------|----------|
| Cellular     | The [sockets](/example/sockets "socket example") example brings up a TCP/UDP socket by using the [device](/common/device "device API"), [network](/common/network "network API") and [sock](/common/sock "sock API") APIs.  |
| Cellular     | The [PSK generation](/example/security/psk "PSK example") example using the [security](/common/security "security API") API. |
| Cellular     | A [TLS-secured version](/example/sockets "TLS sockets example") of the sockets example. |
| Cellular     | A [DTLS-secured version](/example/sockets "DTLS sockets example") of the sockets example. |
| Cellular     | An [MQTT/MQTT-SN client](/example/mqtt_client "MQTT/MQTT-SN example") using the [MQTT/MQTT-SN client](/common/mqtt_client "MQTT/MQTT-SN client API") API.|
| Cellular     | An [HTTP client](/example/http_client "HTTP example") using the [HTTP client](/common/http_client "HTTP client API") API.|
| Cellular     | [CellLocate](/example/location "CellLocate example") example.|
| Bluetooth    | See the BLE examples in the [XPLR-IOT-1 ubxlib examples repo](https://github.com/u-blox/ubxlib_examples_xplr_iot/tree/master/examples). |
| Wi-Fi        | The [sockets](/example/sockets "sockets example") example brings up a TCP/UDP socket by using the [device](/common/device "device API"), [network](/common/network "network API") and [sock](/common/sock "sock API") APIs.  |
| GNSS         | [location](/example/location "location example") example using a GNSS chip connected directly or via a cellular module.|
| GNSS         | [cfg_val](/example/gnss "CFGVALXXX example") example configuring an M9 or later GNSS chip with CFGVALXXX messages.|
| GNSS         | [message](/example/gnss "message example") example communicating directly with a GNSS chip, messages of your choice.|
| GNSS         | [position](/example/gnss "position example") example obtaining streamed position directly from a GNSS chip.|

You may use the code from any of these examples as a basis for your work as follows:
- Copy the source files for the [example](/example) that is closest to your intended application to your project directory.
- Remove all definitions and include files that are related purely to the `ubxlib` test system; for example you only need to include the [ubxlib.h](/ubxlib.h) file and you will want the entry point to be something like `int main()` rather than `U_PORT_TEST_FUNCTION(...)`.
- Adapt the definitions needed for your example, see the include file `u_cfg_app_platform_specific.h` for your platform; some examples of definitions that need to be set are:
  - UART/I2C/SPI number and UART/I2C/SPI pins (i.e. for whichever transport is being used) connecting the MCU to the target module,
  - network credentials (e.g. Wi-Fi SSID and password).
- Copy the make or cmake files from the `runner` directory of the port ([port/platform/](/port/platform/)) of your chosen MCU and adapt them to your application:
  - point out the `ubxlib` directory by setting the `UBXLIB_BASE` variable,
  - remove any definitions related to the `ubxlib` test environment as you wish,
  - if needed, add the source file(s) of your application to the make/cmake files.
- Build and flash your adapted example using your IDE of choice or command-line make/cmake.

General information about how to integrate `ubxlib` into a build system is available in the [port directory](/port) and platform specific information is available in the [platform specific port directory](/port/platform) for your chosen MCU.
